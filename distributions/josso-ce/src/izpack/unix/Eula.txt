This End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you, either a single end-user or a single entity, and Atricore Inc. ("ATRICORE").  By installing this computer software and accompanying user documentation (the "software"), you indicate your acceptance of all the terms and conditions of this EULA.  If you do not agree to any of the terms or conditions of this EULA, do not install or use the software.
1. JOSSOEEInstallation. The Software may be installed as a cluster of runtime servers with an associated administrative console. Each such initial installation is a “JOSSOEEInstallation” and requires a separate License Key. The Software’s administrative console must be kept active as a standalone server or as part of a server processing Transactions.
2. Evaluation License. The Evaluation License entitles Licensee’s organization to an unlimited number of JOSSOEEInstallations on equipment on which the Software has not been previously installed. As further described in Section 6 below, each JOSSOEEInstallation is licensed for a period set at key distribution. When a JOSSOEEInstallation reaches the expiration date, the Software will automatically discontinue processing transactions, unless Licensee purchases a perpetual or subscription license as provided in Section 6 below. ATRICORE is not liable for any operational costs or other liability incurred by Licensee as a result of the Software shutting-down once the expiration date is reached. An Evaluation License can be used for development, pilot or production purposes. ATRICORE reserves the right to deny additional License Keys and to audit any Licensee that appears to be violating the spirit of this Agreement. Violations include: migrating configurations of the Software from one server to another to avoid a license fee, tampering with the server time clock, failure to disclose the true identity of the organization running the Software, or repeat License Key requests from the same Licensee to reinstall the Software on equipment on which a JOSSOEEInstallation was previously installed. Special circumstances or requests will likely be approved by ATRICORE but Licensee must use best efforts to report any activity that could violate the spirit of this Agreement.
3. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation, the payment of all applicable license fees in accordance with Section 6 below, ATRICORE hereby grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive license to install the Software, in machine-readable form only, for the number of JOSSOEEInstallations for which Licensee has been issued License Keys, and to use the Software solely for Licensee’s own internal business use to execute transactions on each JOSSOEEInstallation, all in accordance with the instructions, specifications and documentation provided with the Software. 
4. Restrictions. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, Licensee will not, and will not allow any third party to: (a) modify, adapt, alter, translate, or create derivative works of the Software or merge the Software with other software; (b) distribute, sell, resell, lend, loan, lease, rent, operate as a service bureau, managed service license, sublicense or transfer the Software or any component to a third party; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, operate as a service bureau or managed service, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the Software (except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation); (d) knowingly take any action that would cause the Software (including any License Keys) to be placed in the public domain; (e) remove, alter or obscure any confidentiality or proprietary notices of ATRICORE, its licensors or suppliers included in the Software; (f) otherwise use or copy the Software except as expressly allowed under Section 4; or (g) disclose or publish performance benchmark results for any of the Software’s components. Licensee will not allow any access to or use of the Software by anyone other than Licensee, or its employees or agents, and any such use must be consistent with the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this Agreement.
5. Third Party Software. Certain third party software components (“Third Party Software”) included with the Software are subject to the GNU Lesser General Public License (“LGPL”) or other “open source” or “free software” licenses. Each item of Third Party Software is licensed under the terms and conditions that apply to such Third Party Software, which may vary from those set forth in this Agreement. The file Legal.pdf, which is located in the “docs” directory of the Software, indicates the specific terms and conditions applicable to each Third Party Software component. Such terms and conditions apply only to those Third Party Software components with which they are expressly identified and will have no effect on the terms and conditions of Licensee’s rights to use any other components of the Software. Nothing in this Agreement limits Licensee’s rights under, or grants Licensee rights to supersede, the specific terms and conditions applicable to the individual Third Party Software components. In particular, nothing in this document restricts Licensee’s right to copy, modify and distribute that Third Party Software subject to the terms of the LGPL. As required by the terms of the LGPL, ATRICORE makes the Third Party Software provided under the LGPL and ATRICORE’s modifications to that Third Party Software available for download at www.atricore.com.
6. License Fees. The Software is licensed on a per JOSSOEEInstallation basis, with a set expiration date. Time in use are counted independent of the version of Software or any Updates (as defined in “Updates” section below) installed across a particular JOSSOEEInstallation and do not reset when Updates are applied. The first evaluation term of of the Software executed by a particular JOSSOEEInstallation are provided at no charge. For use of the Software beyond the evaluation term per JOSSOEEInstallation, Licensee must obtain a separate perpetual or subscription License from ATRICORE. The Software incorporates automatic shutdown features as described in Section 2 above. When a JOSSOEEInstallation reaches the expiration date, the server will automatically discontinue to process transactions. A perpetual or subscription License for additional usage or subscription time can be purchased from ATRICORE at any time by contacting ATRICORE Sales at sales@atricore.com or http://www.atricore.com. Licensee is responsible for paying ATRICORE the required fees, and applicable taxes, for any use of the Software beyond the evaluation term.
7. Updates. ATRICORE, from time-to-time, in its sole discretion, may make available for download (or via other distribution methods), patches, updates or upgrades (collectively “Update(s)”) for the Software. Licensee may use the Updated Software to execute any remaining balance of the evaluation term provided for under this Agreement. Any such Update that Licensee elects to download and install will be part of the Software and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Updating the Software does not entitle Licensee to any additional time use above and beyond the evaluation term limit provided by this Agreement. For use of the Software beyond the evaluation term per JOSSOEEInstallation, Licensee will be required to obtain a separate paid perpetual or subscription License from ATRICORE, at which time, a new License Key will be issued. ATRICORE reserves the right to refuse to provide Updates or License Keys for any installation of the Software for which Licensee has not paid the applicable license fees for time in excess of the time limits per JOSSOEEInstallation set forth in this Agreement.
8. Audit. ATRICORE will have the right, upon reasonable prior written notice to Licensee and at a mutually agreeable time, to have an independent audit firm selected by ATRICORE, audit Licensee’s equipment on which the Software is installed, and all related back-up files, to verify compliance with the time, or usage in accordance with a perpetual or subscription purchase, per JOSSOEEInstallation limits set forth in this Agreement, or order form. Any such audit will be conducted during normal business hours in a manner so as not to unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s normal operations. The audit will be conducted at ATRICORE’s expense, unless the audit reveals that Licensee has failed to pay license fees consistent with its use of the Software, in which case Licensee will reimburse ATRICORE for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by ATRICORE in connection with such audit, together with any applicable license fees.
